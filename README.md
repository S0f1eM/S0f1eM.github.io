# React-playground
My react playground for training, testing, improving and have fun !

github page issue: 
/playground show a blank page. 
We had to click Home on the menu to see the "good" page which url is https://s0f1em.github.io/.
But if we directly go on https://s0f1em.github.io/, we had a 404. 
Due to the folder structure of react or redux router? I work on it.

website visible here : https://s0f1em.github.io/playground/
